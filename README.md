#PickMe Ride Analytics Dashboard | Power BI (Simulated Data)
##Project Overview
-This project presents a Power BI dashboard built using simulated PickMe ride-hailing data to analyze ride demand, revenue performance, service quality, and city-level trends across Sri Lanka. The objective is to demonstrate end-to-end Business Intelligence capabilities using Power BI.

##Objectives
-Analyze ride demand and completion performance
-Track revenue and average fare trends
-Evaluate service quality using driver ratings
-Compare city-wise performance and cancellations
-Design a clean, executive-level BI dashboard

#Dashboard Pages
-Home : High-level navigation and summary
-Overview : Core KPIs, demand trends, revenue insights
-City Performance : City-wise rides, cancellations, and geographic analysis

#Key Insights
-Total and completed rides with completion rate analysis
-Net revenue (LKR) and average fare per ride
-Time-based ride demand and peak-hour patterns
-City-wise performance comparison using map visualization
-Cancellation rate analysis across cities
-Driver rating distribution and service quality insights
